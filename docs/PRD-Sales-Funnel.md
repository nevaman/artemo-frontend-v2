## 3. User Flow & Logic

1.  **Entry Point:** The user selects a specific sales funnel tool from the app.
2.  **Activation Modal:** The application opens the tool's immersive modal, and the user clicks **"Start"**.
3.  **Initiation:** The user clicks "Start" and is taken directly to the tool's chat interface.
4.  **Assistant Introduction:** The AI assistant begins its scripted flow. For the Landing Page tool, it might start with, "I can build a high-converting landing page for you. First, please tell me about the product or service you are selling."
5.  **Core Loop:**
    - The assistant guides the user through a series of detailed questions about their product, audience, offer, pain points, and desired benefits.
    - **Project Association:** The user can assign the chat to a project at any time using the header dropdown.
    - The user can attach a **"Knowledge Base"** file, such as a product brief or market research document, to provide deep context.
    - The AI generates the requested sales copy, structured according to direct response best practices (e.g., AIDA, PAS).
    - The user can work with the AI to refine each section of the copy.

## 4. General Prompt Structure & Examples

The user's input is collected via a guided, conversational Q&A with the AI assistant.
